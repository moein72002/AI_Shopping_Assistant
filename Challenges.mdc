# Challenges and Resolutions

Keep this file updated with significant blockers and how we solved them.

## 1) Windows test server startup failures (Winsock 10106)
- Symptom: uvicorn failed under pytest/xprocess with `OSError: [WinError 10106]`.
- Root cause: Subprocess env was overwritten (missing SystemRoot, etc.).
- Fix: In tests, inherit parent env: `env = os.environ.copy()` and set `PYTHONPATH` only.

## 2) Dependency churn (pydantic_core/typing_extensions/anyio/httpx/httpcore)
- Symptom: Repeated `ModuleNotFoundError` chain.
- Fix: Pinned/added required transitive deps in `requirements.txt` and aligned starlette version with FastAPI.

## 3) Flaky LLM tool selection
- Symptom: Incorrect tool choice for code-in-name and feature queries.
- Fix: Strengthened system prompt and tool definitions; kept logic LLM-driven.

## 4) Docker image bloat / slow build context
- Symptom: Large context transfer.
- Fix: Minimal `.dockerignore`; copy only needed files; slim base image; pinned deps.
