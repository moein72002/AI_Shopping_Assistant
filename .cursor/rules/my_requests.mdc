From now on, I will write my request in the my_reuquests.mdc. Check my requests and answer or do them. Thenو delete completed requests from my_reuquests.mdc.

Use UV instead of pip in the dockerfile.

faiss indices are too large and it take too long to load all of them, and 30s timeout happens. What do you suggest to fix this problem?

Delete vector_search from LLM agent available tools.

Improve tools description so that the LLM can more intelligently select tools.

Why when I ran eval_bm25_llm.py for chat_id="t1489-97abda97-dbce-412a-8d09-6d45b01d478f" from .\server_tests\scenarios_1_to_5_requests.json tests it found the currect product, but when I used /chat with the exact same request the bm25_llm_search's result was empty as you can see in its request log file (.\logs\t1489-97abda97-dbce-412a-8d09-6d45b01d478f.log). Fix this problem with the bm25_llm_search tool. Run commands yourself to make sure everything works properly in the end. You may use .\scripts\play_chat.py script for testing (add this note in related mdc file).
