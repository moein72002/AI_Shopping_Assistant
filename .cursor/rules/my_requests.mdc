From now on, I will write my request in the my_reuquests.mdc. Check my requests and answer or do them. Thenو delete completed requests from my_reuquests.mdc.

Use UV instead of pip in the dockerfile.

faiss indices are too large and it take too long to load all of them, and 30s timeout happens. What do you suggest to fix this problem?

Delete vector_search from LLM agent available tools.

Improve tools description so that the LLM can more intelligently select tools.

Run tests in .\scripts\run_scenarios_sample.py in paralel to boost speed. Add number of worker arg inside the script.

Scenario 4: In some requests the user wants a product, but they don't know the exact product. They want help to find the desired product with some constraints that they usually put in their request. The LLM agent should help the user find a product based on constraints by asking some clarifying questions. Maybe it would be good to search and gather some products that meet the initial constraints and then start to ask some clarifying questions based on features and price of those products. I think it would be good to create a find_product_that_needs_clarification tool. This tool

Scenario 3:

Consider english_names as well as persian names in product table.

In scenario2 tests (available in .\server_tests\scenario2.json) user has a question about a specific product. After finding the product using product_name_extractor_tool and bm25_tool we should pass the product id to a new tool (answer_question_about_a_product) that first retrieves the product data (features, price, etc) from dataset. Then, pass the product data with the user request to the LLM agent and the LLM agent should answer the question about the product based on the user question and the product data.

Scenario 5: ID of the product (6-digit lowercase) may be next to its name in the requests in scenario 5 requests. If both of the product IDs are in the request, these two IDs should be passed to the compare_two_products_tool directly. If only the ID of one product is available in the comparison request, the comparison_extractor_tool should return the ID of that product instead of its name, and the bm25_tool should always check its input to return the input itself if it is only a product id (6-digit lowercase).
