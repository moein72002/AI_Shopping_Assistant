### AI Shopping Assistant – Conversation Summary

- **State**: FastAPI app with LLM tool-calling router; simple in-memory chat history for Scenario 4. Tools exposed: `vector_search`, `get_product_by_code`, `get_product_feature`, `get_min_price_by_product_name`, `text_to_sql`.
- **Tests**: Local suite passes for sanity and DB-backed checks (8/8 earlier). After removing code heuristics, Scenarios 1–2 became model-choice dependent; we strengthened the system prompt to steer tool selection while keeping LLM-driven logic.
- **Docker**: Minimal image (python:3.11-slim), `.dockerignore` trims context; container responds on 8090.
- **Docs**: Added summarization rule; appended policy: “No scenario-specific heuristics; rely on LLM tool-calling. Only health checks may be rule-based.” Created `Challenges.mdc`.
- **Next**: Ensure Docker build supports Kaggle download for `torob.db` via secrets; optionally add lightweight test step in Docker build.
