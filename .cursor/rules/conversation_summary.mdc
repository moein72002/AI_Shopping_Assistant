### AI Shopping Assistant – Conversation Summary

- **Architecture**: Monolithic FastAPI app with an intelligent, LLM-driven intent router. Key tools include a `VectorSearchTool` (with a hybrid keyword/semantic search strategy) and a `DatabaseTool` (Text-to-SQL).
- **Dependencies**: The `requirements.txt` file has been updated with fully pinned, explicit versions for all packages to ensure a stable and reproducible environment. The project is standardized on using `uv` for package management.
- **Testing**: A **correctness-driven testing** philosophy has been established. The tests in `tests/test_api.py` have been rewritten to validate the agent's responses against the SQLite database, ensuring factual accuracy.
- **Current Blocker**: The test suite is blocked by a persistent, low-level `OSError: [WinError 10106]` that occurs when `pytest-xprocess` attempts to launch the `uvicorn` server on Windows. This error seems related to the `asyncio` event loop and is preventing the API tests from running.

### Initial Prompt for New Chat

Here is the prompt for your new chat to continue development:

> You are continuing work on the Torob AI Shopping Assistant. The application's core logic (LLM router, hybrid search) is implemented and the dependencies are now fully pinned.
> **Current Blocker:** The test suite is blocked by a persistent `OSError` that prevents the `uvicorn` server from starting within `pytest`.
> **Your primary goal:** Debug the server startup issue, get the correctness tests for Scenarios 1 & 2 passing, and then proceed with the development plan.
> **Start by** attempting to run the `uvicorn` server directly from the command line to isolate the problem from `pytest`.
> Load context from `conversation_summary.mdc`, `architecture.mdc`, and `plan.mdc`.
