## Context Summarization Rule (Minimal, High-Signal)

Purpose: Keep chat/system context lean and cheap while preserving critical information for decision making.

Guidelines:
- Summarize only the most important facts relevant to the current request in ≤5 bullet points.
- Prefer concrete outcomes (tests passed/failed, key errors, files changed, active config, env flags) over process details.
- Omit exploratory steps, stack traces, and transient dependency churn unless directly actionable for the next step.
- Include: current blocker (if any), last successful state, critical file edits, pending todos, and explicit next action.
- Cap summaries to ~60–90 words; use bullets with bold keywords.

When to summarize:
- After major state change (tests now pass/fail, dependency graph fixed, deployment ready).
- Before starting a new scenario or deployment step to set clear context.

Example (good):
- **State**: All API tests pass (5/5). 
- **Key edits**: `main.py` router (rule-based width + code), deferred OpenAI imports.
- **Deps**: httpcore/distro added; env loads via dotenv.
- **Blockers**: None.
- **Next**: Build Docker image and run locally.

Example (avoid):
- Long chronological narratives; repeated errors that are now fixed; irrelevant logs.
